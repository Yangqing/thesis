\chapter{Emergence of Object-level Information in Deep Networks}

\todo{To be written.}

%With the previous chapters showing the effectiveness of feature learning and concept learning in a more ``conventional'' pipeline that employs separately designed, modular components, we 

%As the vision community has only recently rediscovered the power of deep convolutional neural networks, much remains to be analyzed and understood. Thus, compared to previous ones, this chapter is presented in a more exploratory and empirical way, in the hope that it will shed lights guidance for future research on this groundbreaking direction.
