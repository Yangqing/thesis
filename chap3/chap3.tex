\chapter{Visual Concept Learning}

Having analyzed the feature generation pipeline for image classification, in this chapter we move on to a higher-level question: how to learn a visual system that infers latent concepts from exemplar images from that concept, a behavior human are known to perform well? To this end, we introduce the cognitive science aspect of the question, and introduce a novel, practical problem that we call \emph{visual concept learning}. We will then bring together findings in cognitive science and computer vision, using machine vision systems to assign novel images locations within a conceptual hierarchy and a Bayesian generalization model to determine how to generalize from these examples.

The result of such effort is a system that comes closer to human performance than state-of-the-art machine vision techniques. Since no existing dataset adequately tests human-like visual concept learning, we have also collected and made available to the community the first large-scale dataset for evaluating whether machine vision algorithms can learn concepts that agree with human perception and label new unseen images, with ground-truth labeling directly obtained from human annotators. We believe that this new task provides challenges beyond the conventional object classification paradigms.
